PINN (Physical Informed Neural Network)
This project addressed inverse problem of PINN.
This example predicts the exact ODE equation and the corresponding solution for damped harmonic oscillator when a few noisy data is given.

For description of damped harmonic oscillator, See https://beltoforion.de/en/harmonic_oscillator/
